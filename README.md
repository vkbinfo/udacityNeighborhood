![Part of the Udacity Full-Stack Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-FUll--STACK%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

> Developed for Project 5 of the **Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**. 🎓

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 🔰

Included is a list of my and my friends' favorite restaurants and hangouts in the Mangalore area of Karnataka. 🍽 🍲

I have also included some local parks in the area. 🌳 🌲

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. Heck, the icons even bounce like you expect them to. 🗺

There's also extra info pulled from the Foursquare API where available. This includes website URLs and Address. ☎️
